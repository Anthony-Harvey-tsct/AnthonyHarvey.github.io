<h2>Who am I</h2>
    <p> I am a of few words. I was bron on November 23,1998. I was born and raised in Phildephia. Growing up I,ve always been souranded by games for 2 reasons. But I've always loved spending my time playing the game and forgeting about the world. I
        enjoy 3 things in life food, gmaes, and sleep. My dream job is to be a game tester and making or help make my ideal game. A game that has everything that a player can ever want and not trying to drain our players bank accounts and make
        quailty expansions (DLC).I can go on forever about my ideel games but I just want whoever to know a little about me.</p>
